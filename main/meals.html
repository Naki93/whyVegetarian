<p>*Why should you avoid soy milk or any thing that has soy?:<br>
Soy is known to increase estrogen which could lead to a lot of reproductive issues.<br>
So avoid it as much as possible</p>
<p>Gluten free products are a great option because, <br>
    it is essential for managing signs and symptoms of celiac disease and other medical conditions associated with gluten</p>
    <p>Berries help fight inflammation, are good for your skin and help fight cancer</p>
    <p>Almonds contain lots of healthy fats, fiber, protein, magnesium, and vitamin E. <br>
        The health benefits of almonds include lower blood sugar levels, reduced blood pressure, and lower cholesterol levels and they are good for hair growth</p>
        <p>Quinoa Contains antioxidant and anti-inflammatory plant compounds, high in vitamins and minerals</p>

<p>Avocados are high in fat with 60 per cent of this being monounsaturated fats, which research suggests helps to protect against heart disease and lower blood pressure.<br>
     They are also an excellent source of potassium, folate and fibre, all of which benefit the heart and cardiovascular system.
