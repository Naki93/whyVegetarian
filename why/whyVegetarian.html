      <!--Summary about my passion-->
      <p>
        Two years ago I decided to become a vegetarian and it has become my
        passion ever since<br />
        I have seen a significant difference in my mental, physical and
        emotional health. <br />
        Growing up I struggled with acne and since I have been on this journey,<br/>
        acne is the thing of the past.<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        Ofcourse starting this journey was not easy. So if you are going to
        cheat!!<br/> choose organic poultry and wild caught fish!<br />
        I have dedicated my time to develop meal plans that cater to my well
        being and <br/> have done so for most of my family members<br />
        I will be sharing just a few of those meal plans and highlight the
        importance of eating certain foods<br />
      </p>

      <p class="text-center">
        Join me on this journey of being a vegetarian. <strong>Enjoy!!</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Compared with meat eaters, vegetarians tend to consume less saturated
        fat and cholesterol <br/> and more vitamins C and E, dietary fiber, folic
        acid, potassium, magnesium, and phytochemicals <strong>(plant chemicals),<br/> such
        as carotenoids and flavonoids.<br /></strong>
        As a result, they're likely to have lower total and LDL (bad)
        cholesterol,<br/> lower blood pressure,<br/> and lower body mass index (BMI), all
        of which are associated with longevity and <br/> a reduced risk for many
        chronic diseases.<br />
        eating vegetarian is a way to be healthier or to avoid hormones <br/>used in
        animal foods.
      </p>

      <!--Types of vegeterians-->
      <h2 class="text-center">Types of vegetarian diet</h2>
      <p>
        This category of eaters can be further divided by what animal products
        you choose to include in your diet:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>lacto-ovo vegetarians eat both eggs and dairy products</li>
        <li>lacto vegetarians eat dairy products but not eggs</li>
        <li>ovo vegetarians eat eggs but not dairy products</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Our guide mainly focuses on ovo vegetarians, simply because dairy does
        contain a lot of hormones which can cause inflammation. <br />
        Ofcourse if you become a premium member we provide custom meal plans
        according to the particular diet that works for you
      </p>
      <!--Heart Health-->
      <h2 class="text-center">Heart Health</h2>

      <p class="text-center">
        Vegetarians may be up to (one-thirdTrusted Source) less likely to die or
        be hospitalized for heart disease.<br />
        For heart protection, it's best to choose high-fiber whole grains and
        legumes,<br />
        which are digested slowly and have a low glycemic index â€” that is, they
        help keep blood sugar levels steady.<br />
        Soluble fiber also helps reduce cholesterol levels.<br />
        Refined carbohydrates and starches like potatoes, white rice, and
        white-flour products cause a rapid rise in blood sugar,<br />
        which increases the risk of heart attack and diabetes (a risk factor for
        heart disease).
      </p>
      <!--Hormonal Imbalances-->
      <h2 class="text-center">Hormonal Imbalances</h2>
      <p class="text-center">
        Certain dietary patterns, including those high in red and processed
        meats, refined grains,<br />
        and other processed foods, may lead to elevated estrogen levels and
        increased disease risk.<br />
        Soy products such as tofu and soy milk contain a bioactive substance
        known<br />
        as phytoestrogen which acts like estrogen in the body.<br />

        When consumed in high amounts, soy makes it look like the body has
        enough supply of real sex hormones<br />
        like estrogen, and would produce less. Because of this, it affects the
        ovulation cycle which can cause an impact on reproductive health.<br />

        Dairy products are a rich source of calcium, but a high intake of these
        can affect hormone balance.<br />
        Too much can lead to gut inflammation and irritation. Dairy products are
        also said to increase sebum production and aggravate acne-prone skin.<br />
        Some also contain growth hormones which may affect the liver.<br />
        In females, high estrogen may cause breast tenderness, changes in mental
        health, and other symptoms.<br />
        In males, higher than typical levels of estrogen may contribute to
        infertility and other health conditions.
      </p>

      <!--Depression-->
      <h2 class="text-center">Depression</h2>
      <p class="text-center">
        Yes depression can sometimes be caused by our poor food choices. Making
        just a small change in your diet can cause <br />
        a significant positive difference with your mental health
